The removed .

You can find the following resources here:
- **UDP tool**: [GitHub link](https://github.com/EloiStree?tab=repositories&q=UDP&type=&language=&sort=)
- **WebSocket tool**: [GitHub link](https://github.com/EloiStree?tab=repositories&q=websocket&type=&language=&sort=)

Please consider the following:
- UDP works well but not on all devices.
- WebSocket would be ideal, but it doesn’t work as a server in Unity3D.
- Mirror works on all devices but only within Unity3D.

This is why network functionality is outside of the main project, though it was initially included. I’m keeping this note for reference in case you need context about these tools.
